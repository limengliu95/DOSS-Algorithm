Instructions for gettings the LRG DR7 P(k) likelihood.

CAMBfeb09patch -- This directory contains a patch to CAMBfeb09.  It generates the files lrgdr7model_matterpowerz*dat, which contain the model P(k) information for the cosmological model to be tested.  These files are used by getlrgdr7like, and must be in the exact format as produced in this version of the code.
Makefile -- edit for f90 and its flags; whatever you use for CAMB should also work.
getlrgdr7like.f90  -- F90 driver, prints -lnlike of the model to stdout.
data/lrgdr7_ccmeasurements.txt -- DR7 halo P(k) measurements.
data/lrgdr7_invcov.txt -- inverse covariance matrix for DR7 halo P(k)
data/lrgdr7_kbands.txt -- kbands at which to evaluate theory
data/lrgdr7_windows.txt -- window functions
data/lrgdr7_zerowindowfxn.txt -- apply integral constraint
data/lrgdr7_zerowindowfxnsubtractdat.txt -- apply integral constraint
models/lrgdr7fiducialmodel_matterpowerz0.dat -- don't change these files; needed to normalize the model by the fiducial cosmological model
models/lrgdr7fiducialmodel_matterpowerzFAR.dat
models/lrgdr7fiducialmodel_matterpowerzMID.dat
models/lrgdr7fiducialmodel_matterpowerzNEAR.dat
models/lrgdr7model_matterpowerz0.dat -- These are the files generated by CAMBfeb09patch that contain the model info for which you want the likelihood.
models/lrgdr7model_matterpowerzFAR.dat
models/lrgdr7model_matterpowerzMID.dat
models/lrgdr7model_matterpowerzNEAR.dat
utilsforlrglike.f90 -- contains the guts of the likelihood calculation.

WARNING: in previous cosmomc versions, the a_scl factor was applied in the wrong direction.  Make sure you match the convention I use here!
WARNING: I have changed the analytic marginalization over the bias compared with previous cosmomc versions.  This version takes a flat prior on b^2 >= 0, while the previous cosmomc version allowed b^2 to be negative.

Testing -- the output for the model provided is 23.70
